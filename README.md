# graphshooter
Originally named and inspired by Space shooter(A game in which you have a ship and shoot asteroids.:p)
This is a game written in python without the use of a game dev library.
The graphics in this game are completely based on the graphing and plotting library matplotlib.
It employs a hevy use of patches to update changes and interactive plotting.
(A similar version of the game is made which can be played using a MPU6050(accelerometer+gyro) hooked on a arduino)
